# app_logo_viewer

## Project overview

This is a simple project to solve a personal need: I regularly build apps for customers who, upon seeing the app built on a phone, want to use a different app icon, this leads to extra work for me recompiling and sometimes resubmitting the app. To stop this I can use this simple web app to let them play with multiple designs and choose the one they like best before I build it, saving compiling and uploading / approval time.

## Project setup

- Vue 3
- Most of the hard work is done in CSS with a little vanilla JS, no typescript here.
- To avoid needing a DB images are stored in local storage

## Improve and contribute:

Feel free to fork, improve and submit new versions. Particularly needs more Android versions.
